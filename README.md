### Description
__*A blank website with basic files setup for starting new projects with local Bootstrap and jQuery files linked.*__

* Write a method to convert numbers from binary to decimal. The input should be a string, and the output an integer.
* Add Trinary & Hexidecimal,
* accept two numbers, one to be evaluated and the other to indicate target base.

Decimal is the normal system we use for counting. We start at 0, increment until we reach 9, and then reset back to 0 and add another number to the left.

In binary, we also start at zero, but we only increment until we reach 1. Then we reset back to zero and add another number to the left.
